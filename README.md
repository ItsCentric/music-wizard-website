# What is Music Wizard?

Music Wizard is a web application dedicated to providing statistics to its users about their listening habits by utilizing multiple third party music services. These services may include Spotify, Soundcloud, Genius, and more. The web application provides multiple features such as seeing a user's top tracks, top artists, the mood of the user's most recent (50) tracks, with more features in development.

# Why?

Mostly a hobby project. Music Wizard started off with this idea, as I was fascinated with data of all sorts. I listen to music almost 24/7, so naturally I was drawn to making a music-based web application centered on providing statistics on the music I listen to. This project introduced me to the world of web development and developing web applications.
